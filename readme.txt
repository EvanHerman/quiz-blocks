== Description ==

Quiz Blocks is a WordPress plugin that allows you to quickly and easily create beautiful tests and quizzes for your users to take on your website. Quiz Blocks includes many features, such as storing quiz submissions, showing results back to the user, displaying all user submissions on a leaderboard, and so much more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the Quiz Blocks files to the `/wp-content/plugins/quiz-blocks` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the "Quiz Blocks" plugin.
3. Navigate to "Quizzes > Add New Quiz" to create a new quiz.
4. Inside the post or page edit screen you can use the 'Quiz' block to display the quiz anywhere on your site. (Note: If you are using the classic editor, you will have to use the `[quiz id="#"]` shortcode displayed on the 'Quizzes' page)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are user submissions stored? =

Yes, they can be. There is a setting toggle for each quiz to allow for submissions to be stored in the database. This can be turned off to not store user test submissions.

= How do I create a quiz? =

From the dashboard you can navigate to 'Quizzes > Add New Quiz' in the left hand navigation. You can add as many questions and answers as needed, there is no limit.

= How do I show the quiz on my website? =

On any post or page edit screen you can use the 'Quiz' block to display any quiz you have created on any page or post. Once you have added the quiz to the page you can toggle the quiz settings in the right hand sidebar, when the quiz block is selected. Note: If you are still using the classic editor, you should see a shortcode displayed on the list of quizzes. If you don't see the shortcode, you can turn it on from the Screen Options menu, at the top right of the dashboard. Ensure that the `Quiz Shortcode` column is enabled to display the shortcode.
